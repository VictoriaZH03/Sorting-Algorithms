# Sorting-Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++. The project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most commonly used sorting techniques, offering an opportunity to understand their inner workings, performance characteristics, and trade-offs.

# Implemented Sorting Algorithms
The following sorting algorithms are implemented, each demonstrating different approaches to sorting data:
Algorithm	Description
Insertion Sort	A simple, intuitive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
Merge Sort	A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and merges the results.
Heap Sort	An efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm that leverages a binary heap data structure.
Count Sort	A non-comparison sorting algorithm that works well for small ranges of integers.
Quick Sort	A highly efficient, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm using a pivot to partition elements.
Bucket Sort	A sorting algorithm that distributes elements into buckets and then sorts each bucket individually.
Radix Sort	A non-comparison sorting algorithm that sorts integers digit by digit based on their place value.
